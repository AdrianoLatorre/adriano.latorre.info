    description: "If you create a world on paper, you create a window. Usually, you just break the surface with your mind, but you always have the feeling of: What if you could step into that world or if something could come out of it?"

  - title: "The Unbelievable Reality of the Impossible Hyperloop"
    description: "The goal is to put tracks and electromagnets inside a tube and vacuum the air out. Ultimately, capsules will scream through the center of such a tube at 700 miles per hour on a cushion of airâ€”a way to get from A to B faster and more efficiently than planes or trains."

  - title: "Jobs Are for Machines"
    description: "Advances in technology are now so visibly exponential in nature that we can expect to see a lot more milestones being crossed long before we would otherwise expect. These exponential advances, most notably in forms of artificial intelligence limited to specific tasks, we are entirely unprepared for as long as we continue to insist upon employment as our primary source of income."
