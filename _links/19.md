[A Like Can’t Go Anywhere, But a Compliment Can Go a Long Way](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2019/like-compliment/)
: Suppose a person comes across something quite nice on Instagram or Twitter. They could write a pleasant comment, but they are probably going to Like the post instead (or heart, thumbs up, whatever term the platform uses). This creates a slight hitch in the brain of any reader: positivity gets compressed into a little block of Likes meta data that is about 100 pixels wide, no matter if it is one like or one thousand. Visually diminished positivity creates a challenge for the intellect to really understand the response. One must detach size from scale on social media, similar to how we detach size from value with a nickel and dime. A thousand likes doesn’t look much bigger than one, and this becomes important when considering the form of negativity on social media.

[25th of August, 2019](http://danielgray.com/blog/250819)
: I’ve abandoned post titles. Hard to explain why exactly, but I’m finding it exceedingly liberating to just be keeping a journal of notes-and-quotes rather than sticking to the “this post is about this” standard. Getting back to my primary reason for blogging – writing as thinking, rather than writing as clickbait. I put all these words down here for my own benefit. If anyone else reads it, that’s just a nice bonus.

[The Smallest Possible Bit](https://buttondown.email/robinrendle/archive/c9577fc7-80f2-42bc-8e8d-4ec55a2fda2b)
: Whenever I start a new project I always try to focus on what I call the smallest possible bit. I’ll ignore all the layouts, avoid comparing typefaces right away, and hunt for the most important piece of information first.

[The Leisurely Pace of Light Speed](https://kottke.org/17/01/the-leisurely-pace-of-light-speed)
: In a 45-minute video called Riding Light, Alphonse Swinehart animates the journey outward from the Sun to Jupiter from the perspective of a photon of light. The video underscores just how slow light is in comparison to the vast distances it has to cover, even within our own solar system.

[Neue Haas Grotesk](http://www.fontbureau.com/NHG/)
: The digital version of Helvetica that everyone knows and uses today is quite different from the typeface’s pre-digital design from 1957. Originally released as Neue Haas Grotesk, many of the features that made it a Modernist favorite have been lost in translation over the years from one typesetting technology to the next.
