[Untangling the Tale of Ada Lovelace](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2015/12/untangling-the-tale-of-ada-lovelace/)
: Ada Lovelace was born 200 years ago today. To some she is a great hero in the history of computing; to others an overestimated minor figure. I’ve been curious for a long time what the real story is. And in preparation for her bicentennial, I decided to try to solve what for me has always been the “mystery of Ada”.

[Messaging is just getting started](https://medium.com/intercom-inside/messaging-is-just-getting-started-9391897fe455)

: George Saunders, about writing.

[FRONTIERS GIANTS CHAOS EXTINCTION WAR](http://2015.designweekly.atomic.io)
: A geeky, beautiful index page for the best digital product design articles of the year.

[What Is Spacetime, Really?](http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2015/12/what-is-spacetime-really/)
: Stephen Wolfram is trying to answer an old question in a new way.

[Postmodern Jukebox's All About That Bass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyTTX6Wlf1Y)

[Secrets behind the success of Monument Valley](https://medium.com/@InVisionApp/secrets-behind-the-success-of-monument-valley-5742bed3e42b)
: There are no enemies in the game and nobody is killed, and yet since its launch in April 2014 _Monument Valley_ has sold 5 million copies and generated $13 million in revenue by attracting a broad base of fans beyond hardcore and experienced gamers including kids, old people, families, and newcomers.

[Valeria Lisitsa plays Moonlight Sonata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zucBfXpCA6s)

[Sad Topographies](https://www.instagram.com/sadtopographies/)
: Somewhere to go, when you're feeling low.

[The Spark File](https://medium.com/the-writers-room/the-spark-file-8d6e7df7ae58)
: The problem with hunches is that it's incredibly easy to forget them, precisely because they're not fully-baked ideas. This is why for the past eight years or so I've been maintaining a single document where I keep all my hunches.

[_Escape from Spiderhead_](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/12/20/escape-from-spiderhead)
: A short story from George Saunders.

[INPUT/OUTPUT](https://vimeo.com/141567420)

: The first ultraintelligent machine is the _last_ invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. A detailed profile of Nick Bostrom, transhumanist philosopher.

[Church in a nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO_RLoGYJBo)

[Plane](http://theoatmeal.com/comics/plane)

[An interview with J.J. Abrams, on directing _The Force Awakens_](http://www.wired.com/2015/11/star-wars-force-awakens-jj-abrams-interview/)
I have a good feeling about this.

: A step-by-step guide to True, False, and Random.

[The History and Future of Everything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XkV6IpV2Y0)
: Time makes sense in small pieces. But when you look at huge stretches of time, it's almost impossible to wrap your head around things.

[How to Do What You Love](http://paulgraham.com/love.html)
: What you should not do, I think, is worry about the opinion of anyone beyond your friends. You shouldn't worry about prestige. Prestige is the opinion of the rest of the world. When you can ask the opinions of people whose judgement you respect, what does it add to consider the opinions of people you don't even know?

[Why Props Matter](https://vimeo.com/143619334)
: A look at the hidden power of film props, and how filmmakers use objects in their scenes to enhance cinematic storytelling.

[Why is my laptop on?](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/03/why-is-my-laptop-on.html)
: “Why is my laptop on?” does not seem like a complex question, but when I tried to answer it this week—to really answer it—I realized that I only kind of understood energy pretty well.

: Chroma key liquid stripping.

[The Crossroads of Should and Must](https://medium.com/@elleluna/the-crossroads-of-should-and-must-90c75eb7c5b0#.tuhi0nq5x)
: This is a story about two roads — Should and Must. It’s a pep talk for anyone who’s chosen Should for far too long — months, years, maybe a lifetime — and feels like it’s about time they gave Must a shot.

[Jazzbo, The One Man Band](https://vimeo.com/115267724)

: A meaningful talk by Guy Kawasaki.

[Elon Musk’s sleight of hand](https://medium.com/@gavinsblog/elon-musk-s-sleight-of-hand-ea2b078ed8e6)
: If I’m correct —and I think I am— the future for Model X owners won’t involve them being the only drivers of their own cars. It will involve them _renting out their cars to everyone else_ for a price —with Tesla taking a cut— and the car driving itself.

[Network Effect](http://networkeffect.io/)
: The Internet is said to show our common humanity. Through its data, it is said to provide a kind of omniscience, and through its social networks, a deeper sense of connection. For those without access, it holds the promise of a better life. For those of us who use it a lot, its power to affect our lives is clear —but what is the nature of that effect? How does it change our behavior? The way we see others? The way we see ourselves?

: The colossal _grands ensembles_ were built after World War II to accommodate an increasing population of rural migrants and immigrants. Today, the deteriorating buildings are largely considered failed experiments.

[The Weird Simpsons opening credits](https://vimeo.com/139911208)

[_Seven Brief Lessons on Physics_](http://www.sevenbrieflessons.com)
: A beautiful little website for a scientific little book.

[Looking Back at Kurt Cobain](https://medium.com/the-coffeelicious/looking-back-at-kurt-cobain-9af7811d2451)
: _Lately I’ve been pretty obsessed with Kurt Cobain. My husband accused me of having a crush on him. I don’t have a crush on him. But I do have a crush on my youth, nostalgia. I have a crush on what could have been, on trying to figure out what was_.

: HTTP is obsolete. It's time for the distributed, permanent web.

[A System for Remembering What you Read](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/2014/05/remembering-what-you-read/)
: _Last year, I read 161 books cover-to-cover. And that doesn’t include the ones that I started to read and put down. I learned a lot in the process about what works and what doesn’t work._

[Altered States](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/08/27/altered-states-3)
: _To live on a day-to-day basis is insufficient for human beings; we need to transcend, transport, escape; we need meaning, understanding, and explanation; we need to see over-all patterns in our lives._

[The ethics of modern web ad-blocking](http://www.marco.org/2015/08/11/ad-blocking-ethics)

[The difference between -, – and —](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnAaywvd1uk)

[The serious art of being funny](https://medium.com/always-for-love/kill-or-be-killed-the-serious-art-of-being-funny-7cf345bc5a9c)
: Standup is storytelling at its absolute purest; a bit like literature, but with balls.

### The Wick #43 – Cameron, Cajal and Eve

[Cameron's World](http://www.cameronsworld.net) is a web-collage of text and images excavated from the buried neighbourhoods of archived GeoCities pages (1994–2009).

_Cajal, who won the 1906 Nobel Prize for discovering neurons and, more remarkably, intuiting the form and function of synapses, set out to prove Freud wrong._ [Read the Lost Dream Journal of the Man Who Discovered Neurons](http://nautil.us/issue/27/dark-matter/read-the-lost-dream-journal-of-the-man-who-discovered-neurons).

Eve is our way of bringing the power of computation to everyone, not by making everyone a programmer but by finding a better way for us to interact with computers. [Eve Version 0](http://www.chris-granger.com/2015/08/17/version-0/).


---


### The Wick #42 – Carlin, TV and Death

A legendary comedian speaks: [George Carlin's Last Interview](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/200806/george-carlins-last-interview).

For how long have you been [watching TV shows](http://tiii.me/)?

I’d asked on Twitter for interesting databases, and someone told me: Check this one out! It’s full of corpses! But after I had a copy, I realized that it’s a strange thing to be in possession of a massive list of dead people. [The Database of the Dead](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/122456/final-file).


---


### The Wick #41 – Hologram, Lightning and The Same

The holographic principle was inspired by black hole thermodynamics, which conjectures that the maximal entropy in any region scales with the radius squared, and not cubed as might be expected. Understand nothing? Let's see if Leonard can help… [Leonard Susskind on The World As Hologram](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DIl3Hfh9tY).

At 2,000 frames per second, this is [Slow Motion Lightning](https://vimeo.com/133398724).

Without the logos, could you tell which companies own which screenshots? Does it matter? The pattern’s become its own trademark. Just one of the popular yet mediocre ones plaguing modern screen-based design. What’s wrong? [Everything looks the same](https://louderthanten.com/articles/story/design-machines).


---


### The Wick #40 – Sentimental, Spatial and Efficient

[_What do machines sing of?_](https://vimeo.com/133428328) is a fully automated machine, which endlessly sings number-one ballads from the 1990s. As the computer program performs these emotionally loaded songs, it attempts to apply the appropriate human sentiments.

I believe the best software is an extension of the human brain. It lets us think naturally, and conforms to us, not the other way around. Translation of information should be the computer’s job, not ours. It’s what we built these digital slaves for. [Spatial Interfaces](https://medium.com/elepath-exports/spatial-interfaces-886bccc5d1e9).

Whether you use the title graphic designer, front end developer, software engineer, or something else entirely, we still have a similar question as the 16th century punchcutters: “How might a text be received and read more efficiently?” [Efficient Web Type, c. 1556](http://kennethormandy.com/journal/efficient-web-type-circa-1556).


---


### The Wick #39 – 5 Seconds, 82 Elements and 100 Years

Five films in five seconds: [_Amadeus_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-dayb6pf7g), [_The Lord of the Rings_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np19ZOptvQU), [_Star Wars Episode I_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPcQHC2tmZs), [_The Matrix_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkiSaaQLohc) and [_Million Dollar Baby_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lobLVc1zcAA).

I have tended since early boyhood to deal with loss — losing people dear to me — by turning to the nonhuman. When I was sent away to a boarding school as a child of 6, at the outset of the Second World War, numbers became my friends; when I returned to London at 10, the elements and the periodic table became my companions. [Oliver Sacks: My Periodic Table](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/26/opinion/my-periodic-table.html).

_We started with music and publishing. Then retailing. Now we're apparently doing taxis._ [Web Design: The First 100 Years](http://idlewords.com/talks/web_design_first_100_years.htm), a winding, bittersweet talk by Maciej Ceglowski.


---


### The Wick #38 – Ten, Words and Pluto

Breaking all ten commandments before breakfast. [Ten](https://vimeo.com/26687806).

_If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in every sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist._ [Words as Material](http://nicolefenton.com/words-as-material/), a talk by Nicole Fenton.

[Fast and Light to Pluto](http://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000003783764/fast-and-light-to-pluto.html) is a New York Times short documentary found in [a nice article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/science/space/almost-time-for-plutos-close-up.html) about NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft.


---


### The Wick #37 – Kinds, Aesthetics and Creativity

Yes, there are [two kinds of people](http://2kindsofpeople.tumblr.com).

A non-artsy primer in digital aesthetics: [7 Rules for Creating Gorgeous UI](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda).

_Creativity is not a talent. It is a way of operating_. A fun, profound and brilliant talk: [John Cleese on Creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qby0ed4aVpo). Here's [a transcript](http://genius.com/John-cleese-lecture-on-creativity-annotated), too. Just in case.


---


### The Wick #36 – Writing, Logic and Dichotomies

You are a waterfall or some shit and your job is just to let those words flow and flow even if the good ones are all tumbled up and white-watered with the ones that are rotten and filthy and polluted. [How to write](https://medium.com/neo-innovation-ideas/how-to-write-a016e5d898bc).

Though they started at opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, McCulloch and Pitts were destined to live, work, and die together. Along the way, they would create the first mechanistic theory of the mind, the first computational approach to neuroscience, the logical design of modern computers, and the pillars of artificial intelligence. [The Man Who Tried to Redeem the World with Logic](http://nautil.us/issue/21/information/the-man-who-tried-to-redeem-the-world-with-logic).

Is there any kind of middle ground? Are there entirely different approaches we didn’t consider? [False Dichotomies](http://ignorethecode.net/blog/2015/03/07/false_dichotomies/).


---


### The Wick #35 – Bus, Bullet and Rendez-vous

[_The Bus_](http://imgur.com/a/S3k3C#0), by Paul Kirchner.

[_Bullet in the Brain_](http://pov.imv.au.dk/Issue_27/section_1/artc2A.html), a short story.

Le film que vous allez voir a été réalisé sans aucun trucage ni accéléré. [_C'était un rendez-vous_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dwjy0qED2Lo).


---


### The Wick #34 – Crowd, Logic and Stars

Real life, with comments. [Exhausting a crowd](http://www.exhaustingacrowd.com).

In software engineering, Cyclomatic Complexity is a metric which concerns itself with the number of ‘moving parts’ in a piece of code. These moving parts are usually points within some control flow (if, else, while, etc.), and the more of them we find, the greater our Cyclomatic Complexity. [Logic in CSS](http://csswizardry.com/2015/04/cyclomatic-complexity-logic-in-css/).

So what is human existence? How can you actually sum it up? It turns out it's really pretty simple: [we are dead stars looking back up at the sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUo-Q8hhvB0).


---


### The Wick #33 – Mixtape, Afterlife and Break Up

[How To Make a Mixtape](https://medium.com/maybe-its-fiction/how-to-make-a-mixtape-f7bbc3aa2419).

I find myself asking, given what we know about the brain, whether we really could upload someone’s mind to a computer. And my best guess is: yes, almost certainly. [Endless Fun](http://aeon.co/magazine/technology/virtual-afterlives-will-transform-humanity/).

[How To Break Up With Your Girlfriend in 64 Easy Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hfl9e53LX_U).

### The Wick #32 – Groundhog, Flight and Tesla

Okay campers rise and shine and don’t forget your booties. [Why _Groundhog Day_ has particular relevance for artists and for people who want to do creative work](https://medium.com/show-your-work/okay-campers-rise-and-shine-and-don-t-forget-your-booties-de719bc80e8d). (Oh, and that Elizabeth Gilbert TED talk deserves a link on its own, [so I'm cheating here](http://www.ted.com/talks/elizabeth_gilbert_on_genius).)

En route from London to Tokyo, a pilot’s-eye view of life in the sky. [In Flight](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/14/opinion/14-in-flight-mark-vanhoenacker.html).

[How Tesla Will Change The World](http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/how-tesla-will-change-your-life.html), an EPIC post by Tim Urban.

### The Wick #30 – Learning, Magic and Pedophiles

I had a friend who wanted to get better at painting. But she thought she had to be in Paris, with all the conditions right. She never made it to Paris. Now she sits in a cubicle under fluorescent lights, filling out paperwork all day. [The only technique to learn something new](http://boingboing.net/2015/05/11/the-only-technique-to-learn-so.html).

### The Wick #29 – Grid, Failure and Capital

I have been writing and speaking about the CSS Grid Layout Module for some time now. In order to learn how Grid works I’ve put together lots of small examples. [Grid by Example](http://gridbyexample.com).

The word “agile” has become sloganized; meaningless at best, jingoist at worst. We have large swaths of people doing “flaccid agile,” a half-hearted attempt at following a few select software development practices, poorly. [The Failure of Agile](http://blog.toolshed.com/2015/05/the-failure-of-agile.html).

Two decades ago, he was the animating spirit of Netscape, the Web browser that launched the Internet boom. In many respects, he is the quintessential Silicon Valley venture capitalist: an imposing, fortyish, long-celebrated white man. [Tomorrow’s Advance Man](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/18/tomorrows-advance-man).

### The Wick #28 – Ruby, Cards and UX

_It is too dark to see anything, but you smell sludge nearby._ [Ruby Warrior](https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior/) is as fun as a Ruby tutorial can get.

This recommended reading list is for anyone who wants to learn or deepen their knowledge in the disciplines of _User Research_, _Usability_, _Information Architecture_, _User-Interface Design_, _Interaction Design_, _Content Strategy_ or _Experience Strategy_. [The Only UX Reading List Ever](https://medium.com/@span870/the-only-ux-reading-list-ever-d420edb3f4ff).

### The Wick #26 – Daydreaming, Writing and Finding

Why daydreaming and not multitasking is the way to process the unprecedented amount of information we now face. [Daniel Levitin on information overload](http://aeon.co/video/psychology/daniel-levitin-on-information-overload-a-case-for-daydreaming/).

I know it sounds like an ad for some sleazy writers' school, but I really am going to tell you everything you need to pursue a successful and financially rewarding career writing fiction, and I really am going to do it in ten minutes, which is exactly how long it took me to learn. [Everything You Need to Know About Writing Successfully - in Ten Minutes](https://www.msu.edu/~jdowell/135/King_Everything.html).

It is 60 years since our most famous scientist’s death, an event now associated with the weird saga of his brain. Here’s how it was stolen and found again. [Yes, I Found Einstein’s Brain](https://medium.com/backchannel/yes-i-found-einstein-s-brain-c3834429e4d5?section=published).

### The Wick #25 – Abbey Road, Kubrick and Fornasetti

An incredible tour of [Abbey Road studios](https://insideabbeyroad.withgoogle.com/).

[The Director Series](https://vimeo.com/channels/directorsseries) has an amazing 5 part video documentary on the films and career of director Stanley Kubrick. Next up, Fincher.

[Fornasetti](http://www.fornasetti.com) is not your usual website.

### The Wick #24 – Aesop, Max and Mike

There are over 650 Google Fonts available for free, but pairing typefaces isn’t easy and many of those fonts don’t work for typical websites. [Hand-picked tales from Aesop’s Fables with hand-picked type from Google Fonts](http://femmebot.github.io/google-type/).

On Thursday, April 4th, 1985, a blast of dystopian satire hit the UK airwaves. Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future was a snarky take on media and corporate greed, told through the eyes of investigative journalist Edison Carter (Matt Frewer) and his computer-generated alter-ego: [an artificial intelligence named Max Headroom](http://www.theverge.com/2015/4/2/8285139/max-headroom-oral-history-80s-cyberpunk-interview).

[A keynote from Mike Monteiro](https://vimeo.com/121082134) always means active-aggressive fun.

### The Wick #23 – Text, Meanings and Futures

Previously I wrote about clarity being the most important characteristic of a great interface. Let’s talk about icons now. They’re an essential part of many user interfaces. The thing is: more often than not, they break clarity. [The best icon is a text label](http://thomasbyttebier.be/blog/the-best-icon-is-a-text-label).

The way I thought you used a dictionary was that you looked up words you’ve never heard of, or whose sense you’re unsure of. You would never look up an ordinary word — like _example_, or _sport_, or _magic_ — because all you’ll learn is what it means, and that you already know. [You’re probably using the wrong dictionary](http://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary).

A survey of all the current innovation in text as a medium. [Futures of text](http://whoo.ps/2015/02/23/futures-of-text).

The beauty and importance of madness, or [The Reinvention of Normal](https://vimeo.com/122959827).

Dumped or accidentally spilled from ships, blown from landfills, washed down every river in the world, plastic trash has been amassing since World War II in floating dumps, some of which exceed millions of square miles. [We are already on a plastic diet](https://medium.com/matter/the-terrifying-true-story-of-the-garbage-that-could-kill-the-whole-human-race-b17eebd6d54).

### The Wick #20 – Paper, Kangaroos and Trains

[Paperman](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xzt3vb_paperman_shortfilms).
